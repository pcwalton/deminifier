This is a simple JavaScript deminifier add-on for Firefox 4, untested in
Firefox 3.6. To use it, view the source of any page (Cmd+U) and click the
Deminify button, which can be found either at the top right of the displayed
source or next to a script tag.

For an installable add-on package, click Downloads in the top right corner of
this page and download the `.xpi` file. Save it to disk and drag it into the
Firefox window to install. You don't need to restart the browser, thanks to the
magic of Jetpack.
